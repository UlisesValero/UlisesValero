## üßë‚Äçüíº About Me

I am a web developer trainee with a strong focus on front-end development, currently expanding my skills toward the back-end landscape to become a more well-rounded professional.

Passionate about crafting clean, responsive, and user-centered interfaces, and I dedicate time and attention to meticulously shaping each section of the projects I work on.

My learning journey is driven by discipline, and the desire to continuously improve through practice and collaboration.  
I firmly believe that thoughtful development and attention to detail make a real difference in the final product.
